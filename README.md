I'm Frank Saunders Jr, philosophy professor turned data analyst. I've spent the past decade in Asia studying Chinese thought and culture and have now sought to incorporate data into my analyses and put my insights to work to improve data accessability and solve business problems. 

I received my MPhil and PhD in philosophy from the University of Hong Kong and previously taught philosphy in Hong Kong, Mainland China, and South Korea. In addition to my formal training has been in the humanities, I have always had a passion for data and programming, and will share my project code here.
